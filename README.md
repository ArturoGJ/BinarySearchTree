# BinarySearchTree
Creating an implementation of a binary search tree based on the book: Introduction to Algorithms (Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, Clifford Stein)

This currently has the methods:
* inOrderTreeWalk printing every item in the tree from smaller to biggest key number
* recursiveTreeSearch searches for the given key in the binary search tree recursively.
* iterativeTreeSearch searches for the given key in the binary search tree iteratively.
